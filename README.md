ID Assignment 1 - Designing my own Portfolio website

This website is designed to present myself with every neccessary informations to get hired by potential recruiters.

Design Process
- I want to make this website a unique page to sell myself to all the potential recruiters to hire me. The website will contain multiple sections which are:
1. Home page (with contacts)
2. About page
3. Education & Experience page
4. Skills page
5. Participations & Achievements page
6. Leadership Roles page 
7. Projects page 
8. Testimonials page

There are also fun features added to be more visually appealing to the viewer. 
Such as a swiper container is designed in Participations & Achievements and Projects page to 
store all the images and display them to the viewer one by one automatically.

Another feature will be introduced in the skills page, 
which there will be progress bars at the right of each skill to 
indicate my progress on mastering this skill. 

Of course, the website must be well-designed, visually appealing and responsive.
